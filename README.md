# pong-unity

The classic arcade Pong 2D game created with Unity / C#.

The game was done with the help of 2D Game tutorial.

The one thing I changed was the usage of C# instead of JavaScript.

I used Unity version 2019.1.10f1.
But it will probably work with newer/older version with minimal modifications.
